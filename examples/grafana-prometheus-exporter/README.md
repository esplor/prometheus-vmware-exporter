### Quick setup of grafana dashboard
How to setup prometheus-vmware-exporter -> prometheus -> grafana.

Minimal adjustments required:
* Adjust the environment values for esx host in docker-compose.yml
* Datastores in grafana dashboard template not autogenerated, adjust by editing query B.

__Tip:__ Autocomplete datastore name with `Ctrl+Space`

### Docker volumes
Volumes are set as bind mounts, __user id__ in grafana service is mandatory.

## Grafana
Login to grafana port 3000 as admin/admin, you will be prompted for a new password.

Go to Connections -> Data sources -> Add data source -> Prometheus

"Prometheus server URL": `http://prometheus:9090`

Scroll down, click "Save & test"

Select dashboard -> Click new -> Import -> Paste `10076` in the input box "Import via grafana.com" -> Load.

On the next screen, just above "Import" button select your newly created prometheus connection, then click Import.

Your new dashboard are now ready to be customized :)
